This repository contains all relevant molecular modeling data reported and discussed in the paper:  
- human A3 adenosine receptor active state models (homology model based on 7LD4 - Prime; de novo model - AlphaFold Multistate)
- LUF6000 docking poses (Glide-SP)
- Input files for MD simulations with ACEMD (both apo and holo systems)
- MD trajectories (strided, aligned, wrapped, receptor and ligand only)
- Cluster analyses performed on MD simulations with the TTCLUST program
